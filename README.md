# This is **David's** and **KhanSahab's** first WebPage titled _MyFirstWebPage_
#### For the first commit this is going to be an empty README file but as we progress during the day it'll get populated. **_HAPPY_**
#### A file favoritePlaces.html was changed to add couple of photos and web links. Photos were that of Multnomah falls and Willamete river. Syntax gave a bit of trouble.
#### Finally the favorite places for us was uploaded on gh-pages and can be seen there.
#### **_HTML_** code is not much but pictures are what makes this page very beautiful
# Thanks for Reading
